## Overview
This application gathers specific data from amazon.com and stores it in a local database. The user can then search the database for products that meet their specifications based on category, price, rating, and target number of reviews using various operators (>, <, >=, <=, =). Upon inputting the necessary information, the end result is printed in the console and automatically saved to a text file. Every time the program is run, new information will be pulled from Amazon.
​
The Amazon data collected is from the following product categories:
* Over Ear Headphones
* USB Microphones
* 1080p Webcams
* Capture Cards
* 8-channel Audio Mixers
* Gaming Laptops
​
> *Note: each product category is limited to 300 products.*
